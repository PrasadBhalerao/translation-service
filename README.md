# translation-service

The intent of this service is to help developers manage translation key-value pairs used in their application. 

This service helps you maintain translation key-value pair per culture. 

Cultures are added from the standard culture list from here (almost all cultures):

You just need to seed the data and maintain the translations. 

You can export/ import this data in excel and json formats.
